C is a general-purpose programming language. It has been closely
associated with the UNIX system where it was developed, since both
the system and most of the programs that run on it are written in
C. The language, however, is not tied to any one operating system
or machine; and although it has been called a "system programming
language" because it useful for writing compilers and operating
systems, it has been used equally well to write major programs in
many different domains.
